    overview:
      "Influenza, commonly known as 'the flu', is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. These symptoms begin from one to four days after exposure to the virus and last for about 2–8 days.",
    risks:
      "Flu infection can also worsen long-term health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, and asthma ",
    diagnosis:
      "*Physical Examination* Your healthcare provider will ask you what symptoms you have and how long you have been sick to determine next steps. Your healthcare provider will also look in your ears, nose, and throat and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. *Labs and Tests* Rapid influenza tests can be run in the office and takes about 15 minutes to get results. The test typically involves a nasal or throat culture to determine whether influenza A or influenza B is present. The rapid test is far more accurate in infants and becomes less and less accurate the older you get.",
    treatment:
      "*Lifestyle and home remedies* If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:•	Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. •	Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection. You may need to change your activity level, depending on your symptoms. •	Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), to combat the achiness associated with influenza. Children and teens recovering from flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition. Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug to treat the flu. These drugs can include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), peramivir (Rapivab) or baloxavir (Xofluza). These drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.",
    prevention:
      "Take the time to get your yearly flu shot, especially if you’re around young children or older adults. Getting your vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, visits to the doctor or hospital, and missed work or school. It can also prevent the spread of the flu. https://www.healthline.com/health/flu-risk-factors#older-adults •	practicing clean habits like washing your hands with soap and water •	wiping down surfaces and objects like furniture and toys with disinfectant •	covering coughs and sneezes with tissues to minimize potential infection •	not touching your eyes, nose, and mouth •	getting eight hours of sleep every night •	exercising regularly to improve your immune health",
